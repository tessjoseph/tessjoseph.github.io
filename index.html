        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hi, my name is Tessa Joseph, and I am a third-year Data Science and Health Science major at Northeastern University. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive meaningful insights, particularly in healthcare and public health. Currently, I am enrolled in DS4200: Information Presentation and Visualization, taught by Professor Yang, where I hope to develop skills in data storytelling and in creating impactful visualizations that bridge the gap between complex datasets and actionable insights.
Beyond academics, I am actively searching for my second and final co-op for Fall 2025, where I hope to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting. My previous co-op as a Data Analyst NLP and Computer Vision Co-op at the Roux Institute involved conducting NLP and computer vision experiments to assess biases and sensitivities in large language models. Through my coursework, I have deepened my interest in predictive and reactive data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and I aim to expand these skills into healthcare or public health applications, as I have been doing in my research groups.
I am eager to continue exploring the intersection of technology and healthcare, whether through AI-driven analytics, intuitive data visualizations, or ethical AI research. My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that enhance public health outcomes, improve patient care, and promote health equity through data-driven decision-making. </p>
