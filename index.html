        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Tessa Joseph, a data science and health science student at Northeastern University with a keen interest in the intersection of technology and healthcare. During my co-op as a Data Analyst and NLP (Natural Language Processing) intern, I worked closely with large datasets to analyze trends and build models aimed at improving healthcare services. It was during this time that I first encountered the challenges of AI’s biases in healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry, from more accurate diagnoses to personalized treatment recommendations. However, one of the most pressing issues I came across was how biases embedded in AI systems can lead to unequal treatment. These biases often arise from the data used to train AI models, which can inadvertently reflect historical inequities or underrepresentation of certain groups. My experience in NLP, analyzing textual data from patient records, helped me see how language can also perpetuate these biases—sometimes affecting the outcomes for marginalized communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this website, I will explore how AI biases emerge in healthcare, share insights from my co-op experience, and discuss the importance of addressing these biases to ensure that AI serves all patients fairly and equitably.
