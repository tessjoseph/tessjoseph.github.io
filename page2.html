    <h1> AI in Healthcare: Addressing Biases and Advancing Equity  </h1>
     </p>
        <p>

Artificial Intelligence has the potential to transform healthcare, offering more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and efficient administrative processes. However, my work in NLP and computer vision at the Roux Institute has reinforced the critical need to examine biases in AI systems—particularly in healthcare settings where fairness and equity are paramount.  

At the Roux Institute, I conducted NLP and computer vision experiments to analyze how large language models (LLMs) interpret and respond to cultural differences in emotional expression and dietary impacts on physiology. By automating the simulation of human survey responses using Python and LangChain, I identified gaps in LLMs’ cultural sensitivity, revealing how Western and Asian perspectives are differently represented. These findings underscore a key issue in healthcare AI: biases in training data can influence clinical decision-making, potentially leading to disparities in patient care.  

Through my co-op experience, I’ve gained hands-on expertise in developing frameworks that evaluate AI’s understanding of human behavior, an essential skill for improving AI-driven healthcare applications. By addressing these biases, we can work toward AI systems that are not only powerful but also equitable—ensuring they serve diverse patient populations with fairness and accuracy.    </p>
        <p>
            In this website, I will explore how AI biases emerge in healthcare, share insights from my co-op experience, and discuss the importance of addressing these biases to ensure that AI serves all patients fairly and equitably.
